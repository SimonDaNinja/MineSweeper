# MineSweeper

This program uses windows system functions to:
1. clear the screen.
2. check for existence of directories and paths.
3. create directories.
Hence,If you want to run the code on a non-windows system,
you have to modify the functions "clear()" and "CompareToHighscore()"

This program uses the following libraries:
1. numpy
2. random
3. os (see first section of README)
4. time
5. copy
