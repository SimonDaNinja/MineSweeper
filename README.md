# MineSweeper

An implementation of the classic game Minesweeper!
You can customize the grid dimensions and number of mines.
Tiles are revealed by typing in row and column numbers (as prompted -
it's quite self-explanatory when playing.)

Highscores are parameter specific - when you play on a 5x5 map with 3 mines,
your time will not be compared to the best time for playing on a 9x9 map with 10
mines. However, equivalent but different parameter settings are commensurable, so
playtimes for 5x10 maps and 10x5 maps with the same number of mines will both be
compared to the same best time.
